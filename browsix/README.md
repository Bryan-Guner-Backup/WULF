# Browsix - A Unix-like Operating System for the Browser

Modern web applications are multi-process by nature - the client and
some of the application logic lives in the browser, and some of it
lives in the cloud, often implemented as
[microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices).

Browsix lets you rethink the boundary between code executing in the
browser vs. server-side, while taking advantage of the multi-core
nature of modern computing devices.

With Browsix, you compose the in-browser part of your web applications
out of processes. Processes behave as you would expect coming from
[Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix): they run in parallel with
the main browser thread, can communicate over pipes, sockets, or the
filesystem, and can create subprocesses. This process model is
implemented on top of existing browser APIs, like [web
workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_worker), so it works in all
modern browsers.

Using Browsix, you can run a large class of existing
[_node.js_](https://nodejs.org/) and [_Go_](https://golang.org/)
utilities and services in the browser without code changes and without
having to allocate server-side resources -- Browsix applications can
be served statically or by
[CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network).

### The Browsix Shell

As a proof of concept, we've implemented a POSIX-like shell on top of
Browsix, along with an implementation of a number of standard Unix
utilities (`cat`, `tee`, `echo`, `sha1sum`, and friends). The
utilities are all standard node programs that will run directly under
node, or in the browser under Browsix. Individual commands are
executed in their own workers, and piping works as expected:

### Details

Browsix currently supports running node.js and Go programs. It
supports Go with a modified GopherJS compiler.

## Using Browsix

There are two parts to Browsix: build-tooling and runtime support.

Get browsix through npm:

```
    $ npm install --save browsix
```

## Building & Testing

Browsix requires **nodejs 4.3.0** or later, which is more recent than
the version packaged in Ubuntu Wiley. To get a recent version of
node, follow the instructions on the [node.js
website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions).
If you don't know whether you should choose node 4.x or 5.x, choose
4.x (it is the long-term support branch).

Browsix has three other dependencies: `git`, `npm` (usually installed
along with node), and `make`, and builds on OSX and Linux systems.
Once you have those dependencies:

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/plasma-umass/browsix
    $ cd browsix
    $ make test-once serve
```

This will pull the dependencies, build the runtime and all the
utilities, run a number of tests in either Firefox or Chrome, and then
launch a copy of the shell served locally.

## In-browser node limitations

Browsix's `browser-node` implementation has an important to understand
limitation: **you must explicitly call `process.exit()`**. Without
this, utilities will work under real-node, but appear to hang under
`browser-node`. This is not an intrinsic limitation, but it is a
hairy implementation detail -- node exits when the event loop is
empty, and there are no active timers or network callbacks. For us to
do the same thing means we need to hook `setTimeout` and any other
functions that take callbacks to ensure we don't exit early.
