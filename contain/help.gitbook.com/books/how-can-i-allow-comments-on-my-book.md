In the settings page of your book, you can enable or disable **discussions**. People who have a read access to your book will be able to start discussions on your book from the _discussions_ tab of your book's dashboard.

If you allowed discussions, you can also allow **inline comments** in the settings of your book. If you just enabled this feature, **it will only be effective the next time you update the content of your book**. Then the website for your book will display a "+" button near paragraphs for people to start discussions from there.
