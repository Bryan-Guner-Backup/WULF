There are two ways to grant read-only access to a private book: by **inviting him as Collaborator**, or by **creating an Access Key**.

Use *collaborators* when working with a small team and [access keys](./what-is-an-access-key.md) when working with a larger set of potentially unknown users.

Collaborators will need to create GitBook.com accounts.
