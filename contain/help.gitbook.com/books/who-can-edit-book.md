Only the owner and collaborators can edit a book (be it public or private).

If the book is owned by an organization, the organization's permissions are applied to all its books.

**The book's permissions overwrite the organization's**. To control a member's access at a book level, you can add him or her as collaborator of the book and specify a different set of permissions.
