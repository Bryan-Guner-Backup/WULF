[Plugins](https://plugins.gitbook.com) are the most efficient way to include dynamic content or change the default behavior of GitBook.

### From the editor

1. Open the "ðŸ”½" menu in the top right corner
2. Open the "Plugins Store"
3. Select the plugin
4. Cick on the "Enable" button

### By editing the `book.json`

Create or edit your `book.json` to include:

```js
{
    "plugins": ["thePlugin"]
}
```

Details about the `book.json` file can be found in the [Toolchain Documentation](http://toolchain.gitbook.com/config.html).
