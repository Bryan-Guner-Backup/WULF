Organizations are a special type of accounts with multiple team members.

Organizations are great for businesses and large projects that need multiple owners and admins. They include:

* Business plans for private books and distribution
* Collaborator-based access permissions
* Unlimited administrators and collaborators using teams
* Billing receipts that can be sent to a secondary email address
