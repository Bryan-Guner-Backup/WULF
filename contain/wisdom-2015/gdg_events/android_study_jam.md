#####WHAT IS GOOGLE DEVELOPERS STUDY JAMS?
Google Developers Study Jams is an 8-week series of in-person, community-run study groups to support students taking online Udacity courses on Google developer technologies. These events are run by local Google Developer Groups or other developer meetups all over the world. This season, we are running Study Jams around the Udacity [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853) course.



#####WHAT HAPPENS AT A STUDY JAM?
Study Jams are an opportunity for students to receive free, in-person guidance and tutoring on the Udacity course in a fun classroom environment. Study Jam sessions are designed around the Udacity course structure, with a weekly session following each lesson (6 lessons), plus two additional weeks for completing and sharing course final projects. Students are expected to come to the Study Jam sessions having completed that week’s Udacity lesson online, so that the Study Jam time may be used to review key concepts, address questions, and work on individual projects. The live community atmosphere and tutoring is designed to help students achieve deeper learning around the concepts taught in the course.



#####WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO JOIN A STUDY JAM?
All are welcome to join a Study Jam, though students should first be sure to meet the course prerequisites and requirements: [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853) is intended for students with at least 3 years of programming experience in Java or another object­-oriented programming language. You will be expected to download Android Studio in order to follow along with the instructors throughout the course. You should also be comfortable working with code on Github. Access to an Android device is helpful, but not required, to complete the final project. Please see [Technology Requirements](https://www.udacity.com/tech-requirements) for using Udacity.



#####WILL I EARN A COURSE CERTIFICATE AFTER COMPLETING THE COURSE AND ATTENDING ALL STUDY JAM SESSIONS?
Students who attend all Study Jam sessions and complete a final project will receive a Study Jams badge of completion. This badge is different from the official Udacity Android Fundamentals course certification. 

All participants of the Study Jams who complete the Udacity course and final project will be granted a 20% discount to submit their final projects to Udacity for earning an official course certificate. This premium service is ordinarily $199/month. A limited number of free passes for project submission will be raffled off to students who:
- 1) attend all Study Jam sessions 
- 2) complete the Udacity course 
- 3) complete a final project.




#####WHY ARE YOU GUYS DOING THIS?
We believe that supplementing the online course experience with a live community learning environment will support students in completing the course and achieving certification. The goal is to provide deeper understanding in the course material within a fun and collaborative community environment.
