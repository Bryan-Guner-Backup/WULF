## GDG Logo & Branding
The Google Developer Group Logo and Branding are defined by Google and were recently revised to reflect the site-wide changes in color, typography and style. 
 * [GDG Logo Assets](https://developers.google.com/groups/logo/) should be used for GDG events and materials
 * [GDG Logo Generator, Official](http://gdg-logo-generator.appspot.com/) can be used to generate your chapter's logo
 * [GDG Logo Generator, Unofficial](https://abdonrd.github.io/gdg-logo/components/gdg-logo/) is a third-party project, with Polymer GDG elements

_Deprecated_ A different chevron logo used by GDG chapters prior to this brand refresh. That classic logo was created using a different generator and is linked here for historical context as [GDG Logo Generator, Classic](http://gdg-generator.appspot.com/).

## Explain what a GDG is
> Google Developer Groups are groups of people that meet regularily and learn, discuss and exchange about the latest technologies used to create and develop new IT products.

## Exchange with journalists/ press
Most successful exchange happens if you have a story to tell and/or content that is interesting to read.
