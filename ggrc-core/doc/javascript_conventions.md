# Javascript guidelines

We try to keep our codestyle as close as we can inline with [Google Codestyle](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml).

Unfortunately, because of our legacy code, we had to make few exceptions. Best way to understand it is to read our [ESlint config](https://github.com/google/ggrc-core/blob/develop/.eslintrc.json) and check exceptions on their official [website](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/).
