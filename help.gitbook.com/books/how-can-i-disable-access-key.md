Sometimes, you need to temporarily disable or revoke an Access Key. For example when you unintentionally shared an Access Key with the wrong person.

Go to the book's settings on GitBook.com, from the **Access Keys dashboard** you can **disable** an Access Key to temporarily revoke access, or you can **delete** it.
