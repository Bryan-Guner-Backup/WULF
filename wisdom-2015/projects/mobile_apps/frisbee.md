## FAQ for organizers

* How can I encourage attendees to open the event page in the app?

  Event organizer should provide the event shortlink somehow somewhere. I can be a URI Beacon, QR Code etc.
  In the future, there might be the possiblity to get a push notification when the events starts or when attendee is nearby.
