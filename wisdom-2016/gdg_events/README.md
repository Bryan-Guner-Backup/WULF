# GDG Events

There are no particular requirements for the format of a GDG event. They are all listed at [gdgroups.org](http://gdgroups.org).

The following subsections describe branded event series that happen around the world.

In addition, Adriana created a [handbook about organizing a hackathon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18L8_Jg0BArikykWz3QC2Z12n9VsyGZFxY3UmWteit70/edit).
